# JSBudget - A JavaScript Project#

This is my **second** version of the final project in The complete JavaScript course over at [Udemy](http://udemy.com).  My first try grew into a monster ;), plus I learnt a bit about what is and isn't really needed in the app and so my goals have changed as follows:

1. Make the app responsive.
2. I would like to give it some kind of input error feedback.
3. Transactions need to be saved to make this a useful app.
4. It would be nice if it was either multi-user or/and a user could have multiple budgets e.g. household, hobby or holiday.

My purpose in doing this is to practise what I have learnt in the course and become more proficient in JavaScript.

## Usage ##

**Requirements**: Node and Gulp should be installed globally.

1. Either download the .zip or clone it somewhere.
1. Open your Terminal/Command line inside the `TLCBudget` directory and type `npm install`.
2. Type `gulp` to compile and create the `public` directory.
3. Type `gulp watch` and browserSync will open a browser window and show you the result.



## Directory Structure ##
**gulp**: This contains the individual gulp tasks.

**src**: This contains the source code of my version of the project.

**public**: This directory is generated by Gulp and will contain the final concatenated, minified files.

## Plan of Attack ##

**Phase 1**: Cut-up my original codebase and convert it to a gulp workflow, life's too short to keep hitting refresh on the browser all day!

**Phase 2**: Rewrite the CSS to use a flex layout, I'll probably have to change some of the markup as well. I shall make it responsive at this point.

**Phase 3**: Add the error reporting functionality.

**Phase 4**: Add load and save functionality.

**Phase 5**: Add multi-user capability, so the whole family can have their own individual budget plans ;)

**Phase 6**: Allow a user to have multiple budgets. (Dunno about this one yet..).

**Phase 7**: Nothing planned yet..

## Progress ##

**Phase 1**: Completed.

**Phase 2**: Flex stuff done, responsive next.
