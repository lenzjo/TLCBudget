# JSBudget - A JavaScript Project#

This is my **second** version of the final project in The complete JavaScript course over at [Udemy](http://udemy.com).  My first try grew into a monster ;), plus I learnt a bit about what is and isn't really needed in the app and so my goals have changed as follows:

1. Make the app responsive.
2. I would like to give it some kind of input error feedback.
3. Transactions need to be saved to make this a useful app.
4. It would be nice if it was either multi-user or/and a user could have multiple budgets e.g. household, hobby or holiday.

My purpose in doing this is to practise what I have learnt in the course and become more proficient in JavaScript.

## Compilation ##

**Requirements**: [**Node**](https://nodejs.org/) and then **Gulp** should be installed globally.

1. Either download the .zip or clone it somewhere.
1. Open your Terminal/Command line inside the `TLCBudget` directory and type `npm install`.
2. Type `gulp` to compile and create the `public` directory.
3. Type `gulp watch` and browserSync will open a browser window and show you the result.

## Usage ##

If you want to use this app, go thru the **compilation** process above and then copy the build directory to wherever is good for you. You can then just double-click on the **index.html** file to start it up.

This app was created on a windows 7 PC and using the Chrome browser. It has NOT been tested on any other combination of OS/browser/computer, so YMMV if you use any other combination ;)



## Directory Structure ##
**gulp**: This contains the individual gulp tasks.

**src**: This contains the source code of my version of the project.

**public**: This directory is generated by Gulp and will contain the final concatenated, minified files.

## Plan of Attack ##

**Phase 1**: Cut-up my original codebase and convert it to a gulp workflow, life's too short to keep hitting refresh on the browser all day!

**Phase 2**: Rewrite the CSS to use a flex layout, I'll probably have to change some of the markup as well. I shall make it responsive at this point.

**Phase 3**: Add the error reporting functionality.

**Phase 4**: Add load and save functionality.

**Phase 5**: Add multi-user capability, so the whole family can have their own individual budget plans ;) To accomplish this login/register etc. dialogs/pages will need to be added.

**Phase 6**: Allow a user to have multiple budgets. (Dunno about this one yet..).

**Phase 7**: Nothing planned yet..

## Progress ##

**Phase 1**: Completed.

**Phase 2**: Completed.

**Phase 3**: Completed: Very DRY ;) one function to display both error and success alerts.

**Phase 4**: Completed. I used localStorage but as all the load/save functionality is in a module, the module's functions could be re-written to use other forms of storage.

**Phase 5**: Completed.This was harder than what I thought it was going to be. To have multiple users we need some way of letting the user register and then log in. The system had to be able to save and load the data for that user only. 

For the login/register etc. forms I used the content area and ajax'ed the html form partials into it. Making this an SPA :) If you are on any of the 'form pages', pressing the enter key will be the same as submitting the form. When you start the JSBudget, if there are any registered users it will display the login form, otherwise it will show the register form. 

Of course I had to show the user his/her name and give 'em a **menu** so they could logout when they are finished. I thought it might be nice to see each transaction's date so I add that in. It can be toggled on/off from the menu. Another little touch is that whenever a new 'page' is shown the cursor is put in the first available field.


**Phase 6**: 

**Phase 7**:
